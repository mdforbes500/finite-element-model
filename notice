I have read the text and found that P229 figure 4.41 cannot be used in this project, as I can solve it, but you need to put different
part of the elemental stiffness matrix into different part of the global matrix. Spending some time, it can be solved though, 
this would make the code extremly complicated as the elemental matrix generating and assebmling code should be revised thoroughly, 
adding the function of devide the elemental matrix and locate them into the rightplace of the global matrix,
I'm not sure if your problems need such a complicated process, so I decided to change the problem to the figure 4.38 in P229, 
just for notice here
